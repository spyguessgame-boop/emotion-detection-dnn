# Emotion Detection using Deep Neural Networks
This project implements an end-to-end Emotion Detection system using Deep Neural Networks in PyTorch. 
The model classifies human emotions from text by learning contextual patterns using an LSTM-based architecture.

## Problem Statement 
Understanding human emotions from text is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).This project aims to build a Deep Learning model that can automatically classify emotions from textual data,which can be useful in applications such as chatbots, customer feedback analysis, and mental health monitoring.



## Dataset Description
The project uses a real-world multi-class emotion dataset consisting of text samples labeled with emotion classes.
The dataset is split into:
- Training set (training.csv)
- Validation set (validation.csv)
- Test set (test.csv)

Each file contains:
- text: Input sentence
- label: Emotion class (0–5)

## Model Architecture

The Emotion Detection model is based on a Deep Neural Network with the following architecture:

Input Text
- Tokenization & Padding
- Embedding Layer
- LSTM Layer
- Fully Connected Layer
- Emotion Class Prediction

## Technologies & Tools Used 
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Data Preprocessing Steps 
The following preprocessing steps were applied to the text data:
1. Text normalization (lowercasing and punctuation removal)
2. Tokenization
3. Vocabulary creation using training data only
4. Conversion of text into numerical sequences
5. Padding sequences to a fixed length

## Training Details
- Model : LSTM-based Neural Network
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Batch Size: 32
- Sequence Length: 50
- Number of Epochs: 15

## Evaluation Results
The model was evaluated on a validation dataset to measure its generalization performance.

- Validation Accuracy: ~85%
The results indicate that the model learns meaningful emotional patterns from text data.
